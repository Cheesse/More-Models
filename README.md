# More Models
A ClassicalSharp plugin that adds more player models to the game.
## How to use
Place the DLL in the plugins folder of the game's directory. After that, when you launch the game, it will ask for your permission to use the plugin. Click "Yes" or "Always Yes" to make the game use the plugin. Enjoy!
## Player models featured in this plugin:
### Car
A simple car model that allows you to go fast on the race track! (Your texture pack must supply a car texture for the best results.)
### Cow
Useful for creating nature scenes. (Your texture pack must supply a cow texture for the best results.)
### Flying
Now you can truly look like you're flying!
### Headless
You really needed more human models, so now this is included.
### Holding
With this you can show others what block you are holding! (To hold a block with this model, add two to the block ID you want to hold, then set that number as your scale.)
### Male
Basically a human model prototype with more joints. (This model tends to cause skins to look strange.)
